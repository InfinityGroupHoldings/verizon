        <!-- <h2 id="our-goal">What is mmWave?</h2> -->

        <p id="our-goal-1">5G mmWave is a new technology that is being used to make the internet even faster for phones
            and other devices. It's called 5G because it's the fifth generation of wireless technology, and mmWave
            because it uses very high frequency waves, which are called millimeter waves. These waves are much faster
            than the waves that are currently used for the internet, so they can send and receive information much
            quicker.<br><br>
            But there's a catch, these waves can't travel very far, so in order for everyone to be able to use it, there
            have to be lots of small towers all around. This is different from the big towers that you see around now,
            which are used for older generations of wireless technology.<br><br>

            With 5G mmWave, people will be able to do things like watch videos without any lag, or play games without
            waiting for them to load. Imagine if you're playing a game, and you don't have to wait for the next level to
            load, you can just go right to it. Or if you're watching a video, it starts playing right away without any
            buffering. It's like having a super-fast magic internet wand that helps you do things faster!
